# BrickHack 6 Hackathon
Using Wegman's API our team decided to create a way for customers to make a subscription box. This subscription box could be delivered or picked-up in store. If the box was being picked-up they could choose to add alcohol, which would take the least selling beer from the API and include it.  

Used MEAN stack. 
(MongoDB Atlas, 
Express, 
Angular JS, and
Node JS)


To Run:

git clone

cd ./brick-prep/server/ npm i npm start

cd ../client npm i -g @angular/cli npm i npm start

navigate to localhost:4200
